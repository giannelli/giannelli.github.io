<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="appendix-gfdl.html#p-236">in-context</a></span>
