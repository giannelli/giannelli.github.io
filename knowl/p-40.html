<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>Some commands in Sage are “functions,” an example is <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">factorial()</tt> above. Other commands are “methods” of an object and are like characteristics of objects, an example is <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.inverse()</tt> as a method of a matrix. Once you know how to create an object (such as a matrix), then it is easy to see all the available methods. Write the name of the object, place a period (“dot”) and hit the TAB key. If you have <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">A</tt> defined from above, then the compute cell below is ready to go, click into it and then hit TAB (not “evaluate”!). You should get a long list of
                possible methods.
