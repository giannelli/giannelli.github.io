            It would be pointless here to try and replicate the extensive guides and tutorials from the <a class="external-url" href="http://www.sagemath.org/help.html" target="_blank">SageMath Help</a> site.
            My aim here is rather limited. It is to provide a dumping ground an practice area for things I have encountered whilst working my way through several
            on line training courses. It also enables me to practice using <a class="external-url" href="https://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/" target="_blank">Mathbook XML</a>.
