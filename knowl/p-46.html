<p>This expression says that the unknown function (the function to be found) produces the sum of y(t) and r
                c y'(t) for any time t, and that the initial value of the function at time zero is 1. (The meaning of r
                and c will become clear after a bit.) This is an example of a differential equation that specifies an
                initial value, as many do. In this case I intend to scale the result after acquiring the result, and
                this initial value makes that easy. Here is how I submit this differential equation to Sage:
