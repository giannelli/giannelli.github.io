            Lets call the start point of \(\vec{a}\) \(P\) and the endpoint \(Q\).  These points are also the position
            vectors \(\vec{OP}\) and \(\vec{OQ}\) and also lie on the plane (since the origin is on the plane).  Hence,
            a normal to the plane is given by: \begin{equation*}\vec{n} = \vec{OP} \times \vec{OQ}\end{equation*}.
            We know that the dot product of the normal \(\vec{n}\) with any of our three vectors should be zero. This
            enables us to use implicit_plot3d() with an implicit equation for any point on the plane.
