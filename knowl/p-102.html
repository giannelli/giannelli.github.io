                The solutions are printed using a for loop (learn some Python!) and an <!--Style me with CSS--><em>if</em> statement that prints results
                only if \(x\) and \(y\) are real - in the 'ring' <!--Style me with CSS--><em>RR</em>.  There are two solutions,
                which we can see from the plot that this is correct.  Take some time to understand the code used to do the plotting.
