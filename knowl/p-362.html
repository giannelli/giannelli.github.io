            Now add another vector \(\vec{b}\) which is also on the same plane. This shown as the green arrow.
            To do this we introduce another point \(S=(-1,2,5)\).  You might wonder how we know that this
            point lies on our plane.  It was found using the following trick.
            <pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">f=n[0]*x+n[1]*y+n[2]*z==0
show(f(x=-1,y=2))
</pre>
            Here \(n[0]\) is the \(x\)-coordinate of the normal, \(n[1]\) is the \(y\)-coordinate, and so on.
            They are the coefficients of the standard equation of a plane (\(a x + b y + c z = d\)). With \(d = 0\)
            is the plane case when the plane passes through the origin.  The results are: \begin{equation*}2 z - 10 = 0\end{equation*}

            From this, we can find the \(z\)-coordinate of \(S\) which ensure that the point fits onto
            our plane.
