            I have a degree in Physics from many years ago and have recently taken to refreshing my knowledge and bring it up to date
            with recent developments.  This is exactly what <a class="external-url" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind" target="_blank">Leonard Susskind</a>'s
            is trying to help people like me with his fine set <a class="external-url" href="http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses" target="_blank">Theoretical Minimum</a>
            material. Each step of the way I have had to go further and further back into my past studies - almost back to high school!
            On refreshing my maths knowledge I came across the fantastic series of Linear Algebra lectures given by Gilbert Strang at MIT.
            These lectures are hosted at
