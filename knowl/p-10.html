<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5><p>This notebook is an online repository of some Sage Math techniques I have come across.  It is at a very rudimentary level and is far from organised.  It is really just one big dumping ground for stuff I have found useful.  Over time it may become more coherent and be useful to someone else. </p><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-1.html#p-10">in-context</a></span>
